= Environment Variables

We try to let most of the things defined through Environment Variables, as https://12factor.net/config[12factor applications's config]. You'll need to configure through your hosting provider (for example in Heroku), through a gem like `figaro` or through docker-compose `env_file`.

The next table shows all the default Env Vars available when running a default Decidim application (note that customized Decidim apps might differ). The ones marked in *bold* are the minimal required to run a production server. The ones marked as _italic_ are only required for development.
